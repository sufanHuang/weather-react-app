See the app [Here](http://sufan-weather-app.herokuapp.com/).

The tooling for this apps are: react, boostrap and apis. 
The API used for local weather is 'https://darksky.net/';
Compared city weather API used is 'https://openweathermap.org/'.

There are two reasons I used two apis in this simple app:
1. To understand how different apis who share same functionality render data differently. 
2. Gain more experience in handling api keys and extract data.

The structure of the app is two tiers. App.js as the main component, Form.js
and Weather.js are child components. 

What I learned from making this app?

1. How to structure a react app.
2. Passing props from parent to child component.
3. Understanding and Retrieving data from weather apis.
